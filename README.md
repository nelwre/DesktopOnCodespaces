# DesktopOnCodespaces (Beta)

> ⚠️ This project is currently a work in progress and is still unfinished. While I'm actively working on it and making progress, there may still be bugs and incomplete features. ⚠️

> This project is only officially supported on Github codespaces; any other similar services may not work properly, like GitPod. Please do not open issues about X things not working on services that are not github codespaces. (this still should work on personal vps with docker, but no support will be provided)
